Version 3.7.4
1) Form output. Bugs fixed : symb/out/form_out.c
2) Detection of duplicate names in var#.mdl and func#.mdl. Bug is fixed : symb/read_mdl.c 
3) Decay branching is sorted now.
4) aPrintF works correctly even if "long double" or "_Quad" is chosen for real numbers.
   aPrintF routine is intended  to write input file for spectrum  calculator from within 
   func#.mld. It is similar to fprintf function and its first arguments defines format of reading of other arguments.
   For real argument one of  flags E,e,G,g,f,F has to  be used, which corresponds to double numerical type.
   Now when CalCHEP performs numerical calculations with other types, earch real argument of aPrintF is automatically
   converted to type double: X => (double)(X). : symb/out/reader_c.c

5) Polarization of incoming  photon  in case when second incoming particle is massive. Bug is fixed:
    symb/symbolic.c 


6) External matrix element. 
   We have realized  a possibility to use  CalcHEP numerical integrator with  external matrix element.
   We assume that the uses has compiled  some processes in CalCHEP but  would like to replace CalcHEP squared matrix
   element on his own one.  See instructions in c_source/num/usrSQME_dummy.c
