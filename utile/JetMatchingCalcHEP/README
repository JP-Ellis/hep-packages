This is a simple example of evaluating LO Z + 0,1,2 jets process
in CalcHEP with  Jet matching via Pythia. 
Thanks for to Stefan Prestel for numerous discussions and explanations.

To do this you need.

1. Run CalcHEP batch:
./calchep_batch batch_file_Z_matching

as a result, you will get LHE file with mixed Z + 0,1,2 jets events.
The processes with 1 or 2 jets are regularized via PTjet and M(jet,jet) 
(see batch file)

As a result "Z-matching-single.lhe.gz" file with LHE events will be created in 
"batch_results" folder

2. Copy this file into your pythia "examples" folder together with 

main103ckkwl.cmnd
Makefile
main103.cc

an go there

3. compile main103.cc "make main103" and run it 
   
"main103 main103ckkwl.cmnd main103.hepmc"

with two arguments, the first one is the main103ckkwl.cmnd (provided here)
and the second one -- the name of output hepmc file -- any name you like (main103.hepmc in this example)
